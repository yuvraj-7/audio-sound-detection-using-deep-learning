Sound identification is one of our instincts that kept human beings safe. Sounds play a significant role in our life, Starting from recognizing a predator nearby to being inspired by music, to groups of human voices, to the cry of a bird. Inevitably, developing audio classifiers is a crucial task in our lives.

Understanding sound is one of the basic tasks that our brain performs. This can be broadly classified into Speech and Non-Speech sounds. We have noise robust speech recognition systems in place but there is still no general purpose acoustic scene classifier which can enable a computer to listen and interpret everyday sounds and take actions based on those like humans do, like moving out of the way when we listen to a horn or hear a dog barking behind us etc.

In tthis project we perform feature extraction of audio signals and then learn our Deep Neural Networks. We detect  and classify 10 types of sounds.
